 * Contract between the Tauri transport layer (Rust) and the front end.

 * Every connection opened by `gatt_connect` / `serial_connect` is stamped with a
 * monotonically increasing generation. Both sides carry it so that a connection
 * being torn down can never clobber the connection that replaced it.
 *
 * Without this, a USB attempt that fails and cleans up asynchronously wipes the
 * BLE connection the user opened in the meantime, and every later send fails
 * with "No active connection" until the app is restarted.
